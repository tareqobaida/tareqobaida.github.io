                    I am a software developer who changed his career from electrical engineering to software development.
                    I started my career as a radio network optimization engineer in Ericsson Bangladesh in 2008.
                    I Worked for the top two telecommunication companies in the world - <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en">Ericsson</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.huawei.com/">Huawei</a>.  While working
                    in the telecom industry for about 6 years, I used to build in-house software and automation tools for
                    my team and I discovered that's what my real interest is. My next step was to get formal education
                    in computer science. So I sacrificed my 6 years career in telecom, moved to the united states, and pursued my
                    master's degree in computer engineering from Texas A&M University.
                    Since then I am a full-time software developer mostly developing web applications in Python/Django and
                    most importantly enjoying and exploring the software world.
                    <br>
                    Currently, I have been working on my personal projects as well as working as a freelance software developer.
                    Before this, I was a Lead Software Application Developer for the
                    <a href="https://it.tamu.edu/">Division of Information Technology, Texas A&M University.</a>
                    I worked as a <strong>Software Developer/Analyst</strong>, for
                    <a href="https://trecs.utexas.edu/">Technology Resources</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/"> University of Texas at Austin</a> .
                    I completed my Masters degree in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> from <a
                        href='http://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/'>Electrical and
                    Computer Engineering Department </a> of <a href='http://www.tamu.edu/'>Texas A&M University</a> in
                    May-2015. I spent some wonderful time of my life in my undergrad university
                    <a href='www.buet.ac.bd'>BUET</a> from where I completed my BSc degree
                    in <strong>Electrical and Electronic Engineering</strong> in 2008. I
                    met my life partner Lubna Ahmed there, since then we are soul mate for lifetime.
